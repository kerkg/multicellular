# Official multicellular framework in Python

CAUTION THIS ISNT FINISHED VERSION

# explanation

multicellular (mlcl for short) is a game-making framework for Python and built with Python. At its core, mlcl utilizes the turtle module to control and
manipulate the pixels of your window pixels precisely. Also by utilizing an intermediate representation for images (pargf), mlcl lets you manipulate and create them using the game engine. Im currently building it but at worst in a few months, Ä±ll release the alpha version. Ah also you'll have a built-in task manager


# Building
you can't because I didn't make the requirements.txt yet (nor the project) so I dont do it
